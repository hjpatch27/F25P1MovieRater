I have used the LLM Gemini in this project. In SparseMatrix.java for line 434-498 for the method similarReviewer().

User Input:
My test is returning -1 only for a certain test condition when two candiates have the same lowest similarity score.
Here is my method, tell me what is wrong with my logic.
public int similarReviewer(int reviewer){
Node current = head.next();
int numMovie = 0;
double scoreDifference = 0.0;
double currSimilarityScore = 0.0;
double bestSimilarityScore = 0.0;
int otherReviewer = 0;
int similarReviewer = -1;
while (current != tail) {
SparseEntry reviewerEntry = current.getData();
if (reviewerEntry.getRow() == reviewer &&
reviewerEntry.getCol() > -1) {
// Get the movie that was reviewed
int movie = reviewerEntry.getCol();
double rating = reviewerEntry.getScore();
// Find another reviewer for the movie that was rated
Node innerCur = head.next();
while (innerCur != tail) {
SparseEntry otherEntry = innerCur.getData();
if (otherEntry.getCol() == movie &&otherEntry.getRow() != reviewer) {
// Save the other reviewer and their score
otherReviewer = otherEntry.getRow();
double otherRating = otherEntry.getScore();
// Calculate absolute difference
scoreDifference += Math.abs(rating - otherRating);
numMovie++;
// Calculate similarity score
currSimilarityScore = scoreDifference / numMovie;
}
innerCur = innerCur.next();
}
// Check is similarity score was the best.
//if (currSimilarityScore < bestSimilarityScore ||
//(bestSimilarityScore == 0.0 && currSimilarityScore != 0.0))
if (currSimilarityScore < bestSimilarityScore ||
(currSimilarityScore == bestSimilarityScore && otherReviewer < similarReviewer)) {
// Replace best score with the current score.
bestSimilarityScore = currSimilarityScore;
// Set similarIndex to index of otherReviewer.
similarReviewer = otherReviewer;
}
// Reset numMovie and currSimilarityScore
numMovie = 0;
scoreDifference = 0.0;
}
current = current.next();
}
return similarReviewer;
}

LLM Output:
The provided similarReviewer method still returns -1 because its logic is fundamentally flawed.
The main issue is that it doesn't correctly aggregate scores for a single otherReviewer. Instead, 
it calculates and compares a score after processing each individual movie, leading to incorrect results. 
The variable similarReviewer remains at its initial value of -1 because the comparison 
currSimilarityScore < bestSimilarityScore is almost always false. The correct approach requires accumulating 
all the differences for each potential reviewer before making any comparisons.
To correctly implement the logic, you must use a nested-loop structure that iterates through every
possible pair of reviewers. The outer loop will iterate through all reviewers, and the inner loop 
will iterate through the movies to compare ratings. A third, inner-most loop is needed to find the 
ratings of the two reviewers for each movie.
public int similarReviewer(int reviewer) {
    double bestSimilarityScore = Double.MAX_VALUE;
    int similarReviewer = -1;

    // Outer loop: Iterate through all possible 'other' reviewers (Y).
    Node otherReviewerNode = head.next();
    while (otherReviewerNode != tail) {
        SparseEntry otherReviewerEntry = otherReviewerNode.getData();
        int otherReviewer = otherReviewerEntry.getRow();

        // Skip the main reviewer and any non-existent entries
        if (otherReviewer == reviewer || otherReviewerEntry.getCol() < 0) {
            otherReviewerNode = otherReviewerNode.next();
            continue;
        }

        double scoreDifference = 0.0;
        int numMovie = 0;

        // Inner loop: Find shared movies between 'reviewer' (X) and 'otherReviewer' (Y).
        Node reviewerNode = head.next();
        while (reviewerNode != tail) {
            SparseEntry mainReviewerEntry = reviewerNode.getData();
            if (mainReviewerEntry.getRow() == reviewer && mainReviewerEntry.getCol() > -1) {
                int movie = mainReviewerEntry.getCol();
                double rating = mainReviewerEntry.getScore();

                // Innermost loop: Find the rating of 'otherReviewer' for the same movie.
                Node innerOtherReviewerNode = head.next();
                while (innerOtherReviewerNode != tail) {
                    SparseEntry innerOtherEntry = innerOtherReviewerNode.getData();
                    if (innerOtherEntry.getRow() == otherReviewer && innerOtherEntry.getCol() == movie) {
                        double otherRating = innerOtherEntry.getScore();

                        // Add to sum and count if a shared movie is found.
                        scoreDifference += Math.abs(rating - otherRating);
                        numMovie++;

                }
            }
            reviewerNode = reviewerNode.next();
        }
        // Calculate similarity score for the current pair if there are shared movies.
        if (numMovie > 0) {
            double currSimilarityScore = scoreDifference / numMovie;
            // Check if this is the best score found so far, with tie-breaking for lower index.
            if (currSimilarityScore < bestSimilarityScore || 
                (currSimilarityScore == bestSimilarityScore && otherReviewer < similarReviewer)) {              
                bestSimilarityScore = currSimilarityScore;
                similarReviewer = otherReviewer;
            }

        otherReviewerNode = otherReviewerNode.next();
    }   
    // Check if any suitable match was found.
