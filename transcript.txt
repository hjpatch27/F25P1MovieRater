My test is returning -1 only for a certain test condition when two candiates have the same lowest similarity score.
Here is my method, tell me what is wrong with my logic.
public int similarReviewer(int reviewer){
Node current = head.next();
int numMovie = 0;
double scoreDifference = 0.0;
double currSimilarityScore = 0.0;
double bestSimilarityScore = 0.0;
int otherReviewer = 0;
int similarReviewer = -1;
while (current != tail){
SparseEntry reviewerEntry = current.getData();
if (reviewerEntry.getRow() == reviewer &&
reviewerEntry.getCol() > -1){
// Get the movie that was reviewed
int movie = reviewerEntry.getCol();
double rating = reviewerEntry.getScore();
// Find another reviewer for the movie that was rated
Node innerCur = head.next();
while (innerCur != tail){
SparseEntry otherEntry = innerCur.getData();
if (otherEntry.getCol() == movie &&otherEntry.getRow() != reviewer){
// Save the other reviewer and their score
otherReviewer = otherEntry.getRow();
double otherRating = otherEntry.getScore();
// Calculate absolute difference
scoreDifference += Math.abs(rating - otherRating);
numMovie++;
// Calculate similarity score
currSimilarityScore = scoreDifference / numMovie;
}
innerCur = innerCur.next();
}
// Check is similarity score was the best.
//if (currSimilarityScore < bestSimilarityScore ||
//(bestSimilarityScore == 0.0 && currSimilarityScore != 0.0))
if (currSimilarityScore < bestSimilarityScore ||
(currSimilarityScore == bestSimilarityScore && otherReviewer < similarReviewer)){
// Replace best score with the current score.
bestSimilarityScore = currSimilarityScore;
// Set similarIndex to index of otherReviewer.
similarReviewer = otherReviewer;
}
// Reset numMovie and currSimilarityScore
numMovie = 0;
scoreDifference = 0.0;
}
current = current.next();
}
return similarReviewer;
}
LLM Output:
The provided similarReviewer method still returns -1 because its logic is fundamentally flawed.
The main issue is that it doesn't correctly aggregate scores for a single otherReviewer. Instead, 
it calculates and compares a score after processing each individual movie, leading to incorrect results. 
The variable similarReviewer remains at its initial value of -1 because the comparison 
currSimilarityScore < bestSimilarityScore is almost always false. The correct approach requires accumulating 
all the differences for each potential reviewer before making any comparisons.
To correctly implement the logic, you must use a nested-loop structure that iterates through every
possible pair of reviewers. The outer loop will iterate through all reviewers, and the inner loop 
will iterate through the movies to compare ratings. A third, inner-most loop is needed to find the 
ratings of the two reviewers for each movie.
